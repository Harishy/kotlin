NUll safe operators:-
Val name: String? = null or "Hello"
1)Safe Call(?.):
   Returns the length if 'name' is not null else returns NULL
   Use it if you don't mind getting NULL value
   println("The length of name is ${name?.length}")

2)Safe Call with let (?.let)
   It executes the block ONLY if name is NOT NULL
   name?.let{
       println("The length of name is ${name.length}")
   }

3)Elvis-operator (?:)
   When we have nullable reference 'name', we can say "if name is not null",use it, otherwise use some non-null value.

   val length = name?.length ?: -1
   println("The length of name is ${length}")

4)Non-null assertion operator(!!)
   Use it when you are sure the value is NOT NULL
   Throws NullPointerException if the value is found to be NULL
  
   println("The length of name is ${name!!.length}")


5)lateinit keyword:
   1)This is used only with mutable data type(var)
   2)This is used only with non-nullable data type
   3)This values must be initialised before you use it
